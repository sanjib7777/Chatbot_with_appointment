# ğŸ¤– AI Assistant Chatbot with Appointment Booking

This is a conversational chatbot web application built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain** and **OpenAI**. It can answer queries based on documents(currently using sample txt file for testing) and allows users to **book appointments** via a conversational form interface.

---

## Features

- **Natural Chat Interface** using `st.chat_input()`
- **Question Answering** from a document (`sample.txt`) using Vector Embeddings
- **Appointment Booking Form** triggered via conversation
- **Email and Phone Number Validation**
- **Memory Support** for continuous conversation
- Powered by **LangChain Agents**, **Hugging Face Open Source Model** and **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**

---

## How It Works

1. Users can chat with the AI Assistant.
2. When the user types phrases like `book` or `call me`, the assistant will prompt a form to collect details.
3. The date input is interpreted using LLM to extract structured formats.
4. Appointments are "booked" via a custom LangChain tool.
